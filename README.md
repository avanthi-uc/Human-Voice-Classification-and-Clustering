# Human-Voice-Classification-and-Clustering
 A machine learning system that classifies and clusters human voice profiles using pre-extracted numerical audio features. The workflow includes preprocessing the dataset, performing clustering to identify natural groupings, training classification models to predict predefined voice categories, and evaluating model performance.
